# Project Brief

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an idle game, in the vein of cookie clicker. Instead of being about cookies, however, it should be about writing books. The player will start by clicking to write their own books, which can be sold for money, and then spent on tools to help them write faster or to increase the amount books can be sold on. Later, they will be able to spend money on further upgrades that cause books to be written on their own, with the speed gradually escaleting.

## Core Features

-   Players start writing their own books, which can be sold for money.
-   The amount of money books sell for is determined by the genre. Initially, the player will only be able to write romance. An in fashion genre will be provided to the player and will change every so often. In fashion books will sell for much more.
-   Money can initially be used to buy upgrades that will make book writing faster, books more valuable and as such can be sold for more money, or will unlock more genres that the player can write with.
-   Later, appropritely themed upgrades will allow the player to hire more authors to write for them. This will make book completion progress on its own.
-   Upgrades should ramp up in cost and effectiveness, to create a sense of progression where the amount of money increaces exponetially, but the next upgrade remains at most 30-60 seconds away.

## Target Users

We are targeting the bored child at the back of a classroom demographic. It should be easy to put down at a moment's notice if need be, and should be not so attention consuming that one could only focus on it.
