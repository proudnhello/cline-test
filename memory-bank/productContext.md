# Product Context

## Problem Domain

This project addresses the need for a simple, engaging idle game that can be played in short bursts. The target audience is individuals who need a low-attention, high-satisfaction distraction, such as a student in a classroom or someone waiting for a download to finish. The core problem is to provide a sense of progression and accomplishment without requiring constant user interaction or deep focus.

## Core User Experience

The user experience should be centered around a satisfying feedback loop of exponential growth.

1.  **Initial Engagement:** The player begins with a simple action (clicking to write a book) that provides a direct reward (money). This initial phase is designed to be easy to understand and immediately rewarding.
2.  **Strategic Progression:** As the player accumulates wealth, they are presented with choices for upgrades. These upgrades introduce strategic depth, allowing the player to decide whether to focus on increasing their active income (writing faster, making books more valuable) or transitioning to a passive income model (hiring other authors).
3.  **Exponential Growth:** The cost and effectiveness of upgrades are designed to scale exponentially. This ensures that while the next upgrade always feels just out of reach, the player's income is constantly accelerating, creating a powerful sense of progress and preventing the game from becoming stale.
4.  **Low-Friction Gameplay:** The game is designed to be easily picked up and put down. It doesn't demand constant attention, making it ideal for its target demographic. The "in-fashion" genre mechanic adds a light layer of engagement, encouraging players to check in periodically to optimize their income.

## Success Metrics

-   **Player Retention:** A successful implementation will keep players coming back for more. The upgrade path should be compelling enough to make players want to see what's next.
-   **Sense of Progression:** Players should feel a tangible sense of growth and accomplishment. The exponential scaling of income and upgrades is key to achieving this.
-   **Ease of Use:** The game should be intuitive and easy to play, with minimal learning curve.
