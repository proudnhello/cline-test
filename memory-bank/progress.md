# Progress

## What Works

-   The project has been initialized with a basic Next.js template.
-   The Memory Bank has been created and populated with the initial project documentation.
-   The core data structures for the game have been defined in `types/index.ts`.
-   The basic UI has been implemented with React components for displaying stats, the current book, and available upgrades.
-   The core gameplay loop is functional, including manual writing, passive writing, and purchasing upgrades.
-   **The application has been styled with a dark theme using Tailwind CSS.**
-   **A variety of new upgrades have been added to the game.**
-   **Gameplay has been significantly rebalanced:**
    -   Upgrade costs have been compressed.
    -   Book word counts are now randomized and can be reduced with new upgrades.
    -   Unaffordable upgrades are now hidden from view.
-   **UI has been improved:**
    -   The `UpgradePanel` now handles cases where no upgrades are visible.

## What's Left to Build

-   **Backend Integration:**
    -   Saving and loading player progress with Supabase.
-   **Gameplay & UI/UX:**
    -   Upgrades to manipulate market trends.
    -   General polish and visual feedback (e.g., animations, purchase feedback).

## Current Status

The core gameplay loop and UI are in a good state. The next major focus is backend integration to allow for persistent player progress.

## Known Issues

-   None at this time.
